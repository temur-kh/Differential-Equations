# Differential Equations Course Assignment
This is a GUI application created on Python with the use of [matplotlib][plt], [numpy][np] and [tkinter][tk] libraries. Using it you can check the graph of function for some specific differential equation. In this project the equation is y'=xy^2-3xy (variant #25).

In order to run the application, you should activate the virtual environment located in the venv directory:
```sh
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
You don't need to install any packages. Everything that is needed is already in the virtual environment.

Now you can run the application:
```sh
$ python main.py
```

The values of initial conditions are changeable through the form in the window of app. However, to change the differential equation and the analytical solution's function, you need to change the code.
